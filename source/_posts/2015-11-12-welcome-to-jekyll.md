In order to be a successful programmer one must turn away from a narrow mindset and expand it to allow better and greater things to come along the way. Programmers are constantly confronted with obstacles that seem near impossible, but only those who believe they can get past it will. Dweck made profound research on the effects that mind sets have on one’s performances and everything she said holds to be 100% true. In life we come across many problems on the daily, and each time we are faced with the question of whether we will push past it or settle, in fear of failure. Failure is a word some consider to be their worst nightmare, while others view it as an opportunity to improve on their skills and get better. Those who view it as an opportunity are those with a growth mindset. These individuals are the ones that go on to do the impossible because they believe that as long as they try hard, there is nothing that can’t be done. They are the revolutionist because if everyone was scared of failing, no change would be made. Those who are afraid are those with a fixed mindset, these individuals believe that everything is based on intelligence. They think that if they move beyond their comfort zone, and into the unknown they will be looked as being less intelligent because they will be forced to fail somewhere along the way. Programmers need to be open to anything and everything, having a growth mindset is key because the way technology advances is with change, and only those who are willing to take a leap will make a change. They must also learn to embrace a challenge, learn to love it rather than hate it because using your energy hating it and avoiding it isn’t going to make it go away. Also, learning to ask for help isn’t
 a crime, it only helps you because there many are others on the same boat, and helping each other is better than going through the struggle alone. All of these ideas can even be put into context in everyday life, not necessarily just for programmers, walking into a problem with an open mind and enthusiasm allows your performance to be better than those who chose to settle.
