What is a responsive web design? Well first off, ever wonder how a website can look the same on your computer than it does on your phone? Well that is thanks to responsive web design that detects the user’s behavior based on platform, screen size, and orientation and then responds accordingly. The website should respond automatically based on the device the user is using. Everything is constantly evolving in the world of technology, and with all the new devices coming out its so difficult to make a distinct design for every single one. That is why a responsive web design is so efficient because it responds to the device on it its own by accommodating to image size, resolution, and scripting abilities with the use of HTML and CSS. Now let’s get to the good stuff, what are things I need to know to successfully create a responsive web design? There are many things to keep in mind to be successful, but here are just a few. First starting small and then going big is helpful because the majority of the people use mobile devices, and so it is key in creating a great experience for them, but not forgetting the bigger screen users using laptops and computers. Considering context is also crucial because you don’t only want your pictures to resize and look good when switching devices, but also the text that’s on the page. Along with text, prioritizing context as important because on a laptop there is much more room for text to be shown so you can add much more content for the viewer. However, on a mobile device that has a smaller screen, you need choose what content is more important because whatever the user see’s when they first open the page is going to be their first impression of the site. The transition between screens can be challenging but keeping the smaller details in mind will lead a greater success when the bigger picture comes around. Speaking of the bigger picture, there is no way of knowing how successful you’ve been until you test it out, so go have fun!
