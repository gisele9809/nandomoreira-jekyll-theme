Block Designs

	Programmers very often use in block, inline-block, and inline to position how you want your text to look like. Let’s talk about how each one works separately to get a better understanding of how each one works. First is block, block spans out text from one side to the other (all the way from left side to the right side). 
Example:
Jonny wanted to walk his dog but it was raining too hard outside and he had just bathed him so he decided not too. 	
That is an example of a block, this is typically used in websites when they have a paragraph or more and just want a basic look on it, nothing fancy. However sometimes people have images or other things going on around the text so they want the text to float around it. So the route they go for is inline, that allows you to sort of hover around other objects without disrupting them because it aligns the picture and text.   
Example:
Jonny wanted to walk his dog but it was raining 
too hard outside and he had just bathed him so 	
he decided not too.

Lastly, inline-block is a combination of the other two where you can fill your whole page, but what makes it easier is that it allows you adjust your height and width. This can help when you’re trying to fill up a page with a paragraph from end to end (width) but maybe you want it a little longer. In-line block helps you have more control on how you want the text to appear on your page (especially if you have a lot of things happening around it) because again it won’t disrupt them.
Example:  
Jonny wanted to walk his dog but it was raining too hard outside and he had just bathed him so he decided not too. 
Not a huge change from the first block image only it is longer because maybe in this case I didn’t have too much happening on my page and wanted to fill it up a little more. All of these methods are useful depending on what you want to do, these are easier ways to cover the effect floats have on text.
